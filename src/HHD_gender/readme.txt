The HHD gender dataset contains 819 handwritten forms written by volunteers of 
different educational backgrounds and ages (as young as 11 years old and as old as late
60s), both native and non-native Hebrew speakers. 
There are 50 variations of the forms; each form contains a text paragraph with
62 words on average.
For the experiments, the HHD gender dataset was randomly subdivided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test
(10%) sets.
